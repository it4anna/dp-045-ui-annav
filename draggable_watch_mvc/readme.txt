Draggable model: 
	- Parametrized constructor works correct with brausers: Opera, Chrom, IE. Doesn't work with FireFox.
	- Default constructor works incorrect with: Chrom, Opera. Doesn't work with FireFox, EI. 

When draggable_div takes from DOM in DragModel, the version works correct in all tested brausers.
